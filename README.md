# Wastewater Surveillance Poster for Bioengineering Symposium

This repository contains the materials for a poster presentation on wastewater surveillance, which was presented at a 60th Rocky Mountain Bioengineering Symposium in 2023. The project aims to demonstrate the application of wastewater survallence techniques for monitoring and detecting pathogens to enhance public health and safety for the state of Wyoming.

## Poster Overview

The poster covers the following key topics related to wastewater surveillance:

1. **Introduction:** A brief background on wastewater surveillance, and its importance in public health.
2. **Scope:** An overview of the entire process of wastewater surveillance from sample collection to analysis.
3. **Collections Sites:** A map of all sites in the state of Wyoming for which wasterwater samples are collected.
4. **Dashboards for Illustrating Results:** An example of a dashboard is presented to illustrate how results can be made for accesble and help inform public health decision making.
